Recent Updates & Fixes (July 2025)
This update represents a major overhaul of the application's stability, type-safety, and architecture to resolve critical build and runtime issues.

Build & Deployment Stability
Resolved production build failures on Netlify caused by Node.js version incompatibilities (the crypto.hash error).

Stabilized the local development environment by correcting npm installation issues and fixing broken build scripts.

Full Type-Safety Implementation
Established a strict TypeScript foundation by creating a centralized src/types.ts file to act as the single source of truth for all data structures (Order, MenuItem, CartItem, etc.).

Refactored all components, mock data, and logic to be fully compliant with these new strict types, eliminating dozens of potential runtime errors and improving developer confidence.

Code Architecture Refactor
Refactored the OrderSuccess page by extracting its complex logic into a dedicated custom hook (useOrderProcessor), vastly improving code separation and making the component purely presentational.

Restructured the main OrderNowApp component to correctly scope its helper components and state, resolving numerous syntax and reference errors.

WhatsApp Notification Service
Overhauled the whatsappService.ts for improved robustness, featuring better error propagation and simplified, reusable utility functions.

Diagnosed and resolved the final notification bug by ensuring the correct configuration of production environment variables (WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN, etc.) in the Netlify deployment environment.
